I used <a href=https://fjolt.com/article/css-windows-98>this amazing blog</a> blog as a starting point and used my elementary html/css knowledge to edit it. Then, with the help of ChatGPT and good people on StackOverflow, I added some Javascript codes to enable some more features such as window dragging.

## Why Windows 98? 
Apart from the nostalgia of its never-ending start menu, its mind-blowing screen savers,
and its Minesweeper that I never learned how to play, this version of Windows is also released the same 
year I was born. It simply reminds me how far technology has improved just during my lifetime and how lucky 
I was to live in such an exciting era.
