                <p>I used <a href=https://fjolt.com/article/css-windows-98>this amazing blog</a> blog as a starting
                    point
                    and used my elementary html/css knowledge to edit it. Then, with the help of ChatGPT and good people
                    on
                    StackOverflow, I added some Javascript codes to enable some more features such as window dragging.

                    Why Windows 98? Apart from the nostalgia of its never-ending start menu, its mind-blowing screen
                    savers,
                    and its Minesweeper that I never learned how to play, this version of Windows is also released the
                    same
                    year I was born. It simply reminds me how far technology has improved just during my lifetime and
                    how lucky
                    I was to live in such an exciting era.

                            I'm Mahbod <br>
                            I live in Bremen, Germany, and I study PhD at the University of Bremen.
                            <br><br>
                            In recent years, I have been mainly working on spiking neural networks and biologically
                            plausible models of AI. Currently, I am more focused on Computer Vision models such as
                            Vision Transformers, and how to improve such methods, mainly with neurophysical intuitions.
                            In my PhD research, I am studying a framework for networks of stochastically spiking
                            neurons, called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.19.5.1313">Spike-by-Spike
                                (SbS)</a>, which is also related to non-negative generative
                            models.

                            Despite my hatred for Ameritrash games, I am generally a board game enthusiast.
                            Recently, Lars introduced <strong>Mage Knight</strong> to me, which is a game that you can
                            apparently win very easily by first disabling PvP and then body-blocking other honest
                            players.
                            Somehow though, I started to enjoy it way too much.
                            I also never imagined myself sitting alone playing a board game by myself, but the solo mode
                            of this game is
                            surprisingly fun.

                            I am very bad at <strong>chess</strong> (and strangely, I have never felt the need to
                            improve),
                            yet I still play one or two Blitz matches every day.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am also a <strong>football</strong> fan (the one where you use your "feet" to play with a
                            "ball",
                            not the one where you throw an egg and kick each other).
                            I support <strong>Real Madrid</strong> (¡Hala Madrid!) and play as a goalkeeper for the
                            University of Bremen team.
                            Last year, we became champions of the LBSV league
                            (...of the third division, but still, champions!).
                            <br>
                            Here is a picture of us with our trophy:

                            I am also always on the lookout for <strong>hackathons</strong>; and by hackathons,
                            I mean proper, goddamn in-person events where you spend your weekend fighting for your
                            slice of free pizza and try to squeeze in maybe two hours of sleep on a concrete floor just
                            to ship a project (that you will never look at again for the rest of your life) on time.
                            Not one of those lame personal-project show-and-tells that they call “online hackathons”
                            just to promote their half-working frameworks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have always had great experiences at hackathons.
                            Once in Edinburgh, we pitched self-warming socks that you wear inside a car for some reason,
                            and also won an Amazon Echo for a project I can’t even remember. <br>
                            And once in Oxford, a sponsor gave us a bunch of 3D data (PCD) from their smart cars and asked us
                            to make the best possible visualization.
                            So <em>naturally</em>, we decided to show the data inside Minecraft.
                            And then, obviously, we had to build a tool to scan yourself (using LiDAR) and put yourself
                            into Minecraft. <br>
                            <em>Somehow</em>, that won us the prize.
                        </p>

                            Unfortunately, I have not found any interesting hackathons since I moved to Bremen. So, if you found

                        <h2>Programming</h2>
                        <p>
                            Previously, I had this section filled with all the programming languages and libraries I
                            used,
                            as well as the projects I worked on. Recently though, after using a bunch of AI coding
                            models
                            and seeing how impressively good they have become, I started to question whether this is
                            still
                            relevant, or if it will be relevant in the near future.
                            So, I decided to instead make this a very short description of how I feel about the
                            programming
                            languages that I know.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Currently, most of the time (99% of the time) I am using Python.
                            I like it. It is simple, it is enjoyable, it is fun to work with.
                            My past experience has also shown me that
                            “if there is a way to do it in Python, just do it in Python”.
                            Like any other sane human, I do my AI stuff in PyTorch.
                            Sometimes, I even try to write my own custom PyTorch AutoGrad implementations, and then I
                            cry.
                            Back in the day, I also tried some web development with Python and did some Telegram bot
                            development using FastAPI and Flask, which was fun.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I once saw <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia">this blog
                                post</a>
                            and I was like “Hell yeah!”.
                            So I started learning Julia and used it for my master’s dissertation,
                            which led to my Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework,
                            <a href="https://github.com/mahbodnr/FastSpike.jl">FastSpike.jl</a>,
                            with fast GPU-based simulation.
                            Do not regret it. Will not recommend it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I had to learn MATLAB and R at some point, which ironically made my life much better —
                            because every day that I do not have to use these abominations of programming languages,
                            I am a bit happier.
                            I used to be able to write decent C++ code, but it has been a long time since I last used
                            it.
                            If there is ever a good excuse, I will happily jump back in and relearn it.
                            I also wrote some Solidity code for a blockchain course at university, and that was fun.
                        </p>

                            In recent years, I have been mainly working on spiking neural networks and biologically
                            plausible models of AI. Currently, I am more focused on Computer Vision models such as
                            Vision Transformers, and how to improve such methods, mainly with neurophysical intuitions.
                            In my PhD research, I am studying a framework for networks of stochastically spiking
                            neurons, called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.19.5.1313">Spike-by-Spike
                                (SbS)</a>, which is also related to non-negative generative
                            models.
